Here is my phpMyAdmin report for March 2021.

<!-- more -->

## First week (09)

### Monday (01/03/2021)

I worked on writing tests and finding out about a very old bug (phpMyAdmin 3.5.1+).

### Tuesday

I removed the last TravisCI config, and worked on migrating the error report server to a newer cake PHP version.

### Wednesday

More work on migrating to cake PHP 4.

### Thursday

A lot of issue triage and test writing.
Also replaced some deprecated code from the test-suite. And worked on more testing code improvements.

### Friday

I did review/fix and test pull-requests.
Write tests for pull-requests and remove some phpunit deprecations.
Removed and improved some code that related to constants.
I moved out some code and wrote tests for it.

### Saturday

I made bug fixes and test writing to cover the fixes.
Also added a bunch of testing methods to create better tests and all the work ended up into a 3% coverage bump.
