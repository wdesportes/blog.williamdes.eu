Here is my phpMyAdmin report for August 2022.

<!-- more -->

## First week (31)

On the docker repository I made some coding standard improvements.
And made documentation improvements by adding missing new Docker ENVs to our embed documentation.

## Second week (32)

On the docker repository I made some documentation improvements and also made some changes on our embed documentation.
I did changes on our server to add more storage on the Sentry instance.

## Third week (33)

I worked on fixing a JS error (issue [#17620](https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/issues/17620)) and that ended up in multiple fixes around the "Debug SQL" console feature.
Also fixed a JS errors on the Designer (issue [#17543](https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/issues/17543) and issue [#17546](https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/issues/17546)). And fixed some translation strings.

## Fourth week (34)
