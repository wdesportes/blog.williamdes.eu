Here is my phpMyAdmin report for October 2022.

<!-- more -->

## First week (40)

__not working on the project__

## Second week (41)

I reviewed and merged quite a lot of pull-requests.
Also made adjustments of tests. Rebased and tested contributors work.

## Third week (42)

I sorted out a lof of old issues, reviewed a lot of pull-requests.
Also fixed UI bugs on the old confirm modal about close modals and go/cancel buttons.
And fixed bugs on the monitor page.

## Fourth week (43)

I started by fixing bugs and made changes to the issue and pull-request workflow and wrote them into a [wiki page](https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/wiki/Issue-and-pull-request-management)
Merged and reviewed contributions. Changed jquery migrate and validation to the `.min.js` version.
I wrote fixes for the multi table query interface. And improved some details on Metro theme.
And finally I wrote more bug fixes and changed js.cookie.js to the `.min.js` version.
