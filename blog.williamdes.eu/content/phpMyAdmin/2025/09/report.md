Here is my phpMyAdmin report for September 2025.

<!-- more -->

In September I worked on our infrastructure and Scrutinizer. And merged some contributions.

## First week (36)

I upgraded the mail VM from `bookworm` to `trixie`.
I then had a mailman web upgrade issue, duplicate emails (casing issue) for some users. After fixing that I managed to finish the upgrade.
I disabled a cron for the `ircbot` that is not used anymore.
And did some configuration work on "DMARC mitigation" for all the phpMyAdmin lists.

### On motranslator

- [4ac3205cab - Improve the exception when the APCu extension is not enabled or installed](https://github.com/phpmyadmin/motranslator/commit/4ac3205cabaf1c4f0525c2a49cbd5fe585c87320)

### Debian packaging

I did some cleaning up and uploaded motranslator as `5.4.0-2`.

And for `phpmyadmin` I sent `4:5.2.2-really+dfsg-2` to unstable after updating a source file to fix `CVE-2025-3573` and fixing tests for PHPUnit 12.
