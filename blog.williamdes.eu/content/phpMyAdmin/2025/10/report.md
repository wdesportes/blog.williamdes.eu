Here is my phpMyAdmin report for October 2025.

<!-- more -->

In October I worked on updating phpMyAdmin to 5.2.3 in different distributions.

## First week (40)

**Nothing to report**

## Second week (41)

phpMyAdmin 5.2.3 was released, I worked on updating our Docker image:
- Installed the `uploadprogress` PHP extension
- Updated to PHP 8.3

Then I packaged phpMyAdmin 5.2.3 into Debian.

## Third week (42)

Debian is migrating to PSR/http-message v2, I made the patch in phpMyAdmin and imported it into Debian.

## Fourth week (43)
