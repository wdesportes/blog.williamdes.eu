Here is my phpMyAdmin report for November 2025.

<!-- more -->

In November I was not active on the project.

## First week (45)

**Nothing to report**

## Second week (46)

**Nothing to report**

## Third week (47)

**Nothing to report**

## Fourth week (48)

I merged a PR and removed `roave/security-advisories` in [6f8e08653d](https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/commit/6f8e08653daca495ca6d1e2dbb9032c1d0c242d0) because composer 2.9. has it built in now.
