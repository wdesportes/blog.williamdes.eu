After a lot of hours contributing to phpMyAdmin I received an unexpected invitation to join the team.
That day was on the 27/08/2018, a very happy day !
Since then I am a [phpMyAdmin team member](https://phpmyadmin.net/team).

I worked for phpMyAdmin from the 01/12/2020 to 30/11/2022.
With some months where I was working for other clients or my own projects.
