<span id="continue-reading"></span><h2 id="first-week-01">First week (01)</h2>
<p>This week was a quite busy one and I could not dev as much as I expected. Real life is important too ;p</p>
<h3 id="monday-04-01-2021">Monday (04/01/2021)</h3>
<p>More work on the Debian 5.0 version.</p>
<h3 id="tuesday">Tuesday</h3>
<p>More work on the Debian 5.0 version.</p>
<h3 id="wednesday">Wednesday</h3>
<p>More work on the Debian 5.0 version.</p>
<h3 id="thursday">Thursday</h3>
<p>More work on the Debian 5.0 version.</p>
<h3 id="friday">Friday</h3>
<p>The Debian version <code>5.0.4+dfsg1-1</code> landed after a lot lot lot of time fixing and improving things for 5.0 series to be accepted into Debian. Thanks to everybody that helped me and reviewed my work. The <a href="https://salsa.debian.org/phpmyadmin-team/phpmyadmin/-/merge_requests/30">pull-request</a> was <a href="https://salsa.debian.org/phpmyadmin-team/phpmyadmin/-/commit/f8ca6504dc6f1ee6a8b2fcbb29b9baff30017ed1">merged</a> after 3 months open lacking reviews and me pushing more and more commits.</p>
<h3 id="saturday">Saturday</h3>
<p><strong>Nothing to report</strong></p>
<h3 id="sunday">Sunday</h3>
<p>I migrated sql-parser to GitHub actions. Still working on the Debian package.</p>
<h2 id="second-week-02">Second week (02)</h2>
<h3 id="monday-11-01-2021">Monday (11/01/2021)</h3>
<p>And I worked on copyright updates for the Debian version 5.0.4+dfsg2, that required to search on each file for missing copyrights in the d/copyright file and document them. Most of the source files that where excluded are now back.
I also had to remove the lib that finds out the strength of passwords because it could not be re-build from source (DFSG not compatible). All the <code>.min.js</code> files had to be <a href="https://salsa.debian.org/phpmyadmin-team/phpmyadmin/-/commit/c4b28b4c5ca955c7ddf1858b6e5e9f89d3505216">re-built from source</a>, <a href="https://salsa.debian.org/phpmyadmin-team/phpmyadmin/-/commit/abac8a5cf05e2955a2c5bd14dc52c0ab75405659">I added the missing source files</a> to the <code>debian/missing-sources</code> directory. The Debian version no more has <code>zxcvbn</code> until the from source issue can be solved. For now <code>?</code> force is displayed when you type passwords.</p>
<h3 id="tuesday-1">Tuesday</h3>
<p>All the work from yesterday landed into <a href="https://salsa.debian.org/phpmyadmin-team/phpmyadmin/-/commit/9206cece4599be77d436057fe51f7b106e9b8de2">a merge</a> and David did upload the changes to unstable.</p>

On <code>twig-i18n-extension</code> I moved to GitHub actions and did setup phpstan.
Also <code>phpmyadmin/coding-standard</code> has a quick move to GitHub actions and I found out <a href="https://github.com/phpmyadmin/coding-standard/pull/9">a licensing issue</a>.</p>

And updated the Ubuntu PPA Bionic to <code>5.0.4</code>.</p>
<h3 id="friday-1">Friday</h3>

<h3 id="friday-2">Friday</h3>
<p>Some more cleaning on Weblate and some PR updates.
